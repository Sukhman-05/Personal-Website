# Personal Portfolio with To-Do App & Workout Tracker

This repository contains my personal portfolio website that showcases my skills and projects. Included within the portfolio are two interactive web applications:
1. **To-Do App**: A task management app to create, track, and delete tasks.
2. **Workout Tracker App**: An app to log workouts, track exercise routines, and monitor progress.

Both apps are built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and feature modern design and user-friendly interfaces.

## Features

### To-Do App:
- **Task Creation**: Allows users to add new tasks with a simple text input.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks once completed.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, ensuring data persistence between visits.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes for a better mobile experience.

### Workout Tracker App:
- **Log Workouts**: Allows users to input workout details (exercise type, duration, sets, reps, etc.).
- **Track Progress**: Helps users monitor their fitness progress over time.
- **Simple UI**: Clean, minimal design focused on functionality and ease of use.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the website and apps.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, with focus on responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interaction, including task management and workout tracking.
- **LocalStorage**: Used to save and persist data for the To-Do App.
